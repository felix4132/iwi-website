# IWI Website - HKA

This repository contains the website of the **Fachschaft IWI** at the University
of Applied Sciences Karlsruhe (HKA). Welcome!

## What Can I Do Here?

You're most likely a student at the IWI faculty of HKA. Glad to have you here!

We develop both the design and the website setup ourselves. (Our website is
statically generated using Next.js, which is a React framework.) All parts of
the website, foremost the content, need constant care and maintenance. Pick an
area you feel comfortable in and start contributing!

And even if you're new to all this, and haven't worked with git, Node.js and
all that other stuff before: This is a great opportunity to get to know them :)

## Contributing

If you've read this far, you probably want to do something. That's great!
Everything we do is volunteer work, and we are excited for everyone who's willing
to jump in. We hope this list helps with your decision on what to do:

* [First, read our contribution guidelines](./docs/contribute.md)
* [Create and update content (such as News, FAQs, or pages)](./docs/content.md)
* [Work on the design](./docs/design.md)
* [Implement a new technical feature](./docs/develop.md)
* [Understand and improve deployment, testing, and overall workflow](./docs/deploy.md)

## Quickstart

**Prerequisites for development: Node.js and a package manager (`npm` or `yarn`).**

If you just want to add content, you don't need to install all this necessarily.
However, you won't be able to see the rendered results of your changes.

```shell
git clone <repo-url> iwi-website
cd iwi-website
npm install
npm run dev
```

You're ready to go! The website will be available at
[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). For everything else, see the
[documentation](./docs/readme.md).
